Inputs:
    Various moving average slopes
    indicators

Output:
    The output should be only one neuron, from 0 to 1..
    The important part here, is to not train it to spit out a value from the input, nor a similar one.
    It should predict how much will the market move up or down > i guess i'll try with %

Try sine indicator
try RSI + ADX + CCI
