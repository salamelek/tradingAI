Trading as task:
    1) Regression:
        Predicting continuous numerical values based on input features. Example: predicting house prices based on features like area, location, etc.

    2) Clustering:
        Grouping similar data points together based on their features without predefined labels. Example: customer segmentation for targeted marketing.

    3) Time Series Analysis:
        Analyzing and predicting data points collected or recorded in a sequential manner, often with time stamps. Example: predicting stock prices.

    4) Reinforcement Learning:
        Teaching agents to make sequences of decisions in an environment to achieve a goal, often used in robotics and game-playing.

    5) Classification:
        Classificate chart as "Strong bull, bull, range, bear, strong bear" and yada yada



Activation functions:
    The most used activation function is relu, because it works best. The neuron is inactive if the threshold is not met and has some values if its met
    So don't use tanH or even sigmoid, it's trash. It's much better to use RELU just learn how to use them
